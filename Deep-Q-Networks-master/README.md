## Training models

### Simple DQN [1]

```bash
python dqn_atari.py \
  --env Enduro-v0 \
  --gpu 0 \
  --model convnet \
  --train_policy epgreedy \
  --std_img \
  --optimizer adam \
  --learning_rate 0.0001
```

### Dueling DQN [4]

Simply replace `--model convnet` with `--model dueling_convnet` in the above command. Also try out other network architectures in `deeprl/networks.py`.
